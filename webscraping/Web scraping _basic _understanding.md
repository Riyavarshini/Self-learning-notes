## WEB SCRAPING
Web scraping, also known as web harvesting or web data extraction, is the process of automatically extracting information from websites. It involves accessing web pages, downloading the HTML content, and then parsing and extracting the desired data from that content. Web scraping is a valuable technique for collecting data from the web for a wide range of purposes, such as data analysis, research, monitoring, and more.

### Key Concepts and Steps in Web Scraping:
1. Sending HTTP Requests
2. Downloading HTML Content
3. Parsing HTML
4. Data Extraction
5. Data Cleaning and Transformation
6. Storage and Analysis

### Ethical and Legal Considerations:
When web scraping, it's important to consider the legal and ethical aspects:

* Respect a website's robots.txt file, which may provide guidelines on what can and cannot be scraped.
* Be mindful of a website's terms of service or terms of use. Some websites may explicitly prohibit or restrict web scraping.
* Do not overload a website's server with excessive requests, as this can impact its performance.

### Tools and Libraries for Web Scraping:

1. Python: Python is a popular language for web scraping, and it offers many libraries, including requests for sending HTTP requests, BeautifulSoup for HTML parsing, and Scrapy for more advanced web scraping tasks.

2. Scrapy: Scrapy is an open-source and powerful web scraping framework that simplifies the process of creating web crawlers for more complex scraping tasks.

3. JavaScript: For websites that heavily rely on JavaScript to load content, you may need to use headless browsers like Puppeteer (for Node.js) or Selenium (with Python) to interact with and scrape the content.

4. APIs: In some cases, websites offer APIs that allow you to access their data more easily and legally.

Here we could discuss on basic web scrapping with python library ***BeautifulSoup***

## BEAUTIFULSOUP
**`BeautifulSoup`** is a Python library that is commonly used for web scraping HTML and XML documents. It provides a convenient and Pythonic way to parse and navigate the structure of web pages, extract data, and perform various operations on web content. Beautiful Soup makes it easier to work with structured data within HTML and XML documents, and it is widely used in conjunction with other Python libraries like requests for web scraping.

### Key Features and Uses:
1. **Parsing HTML and XML:**
 Beautiful Soup allows you to parse HTML and XML documents, creating a parse tree that represents the structure of the document. It provides various methods to search, navigate, and manipulate this tree.

3. **Traversal and Searching:**
 You can search for specific tags, extract their attributes, or navigate through the document's elements using Beautiful Soup's methods and functions.

4. **Data Extraction:**
 Beautiful Soup is excellent for extracting data from web pages, whether it's text, links, images, tables, or any other structured content.

##### INSTALLATION:
Provide the below command in your terminal or bash
```bash
!pip3 install beautifulsoup4
```

## REQUESTS
**`requests`** is a Python library that simplifies the process of making HTTP requests and interacting with web services. It is one of the most widely used libraries for sending HTTP requests in Python and is an essential tool for web scraping, API integration, and web-based data retrieval. With requests, you can easily access web resources, retrieve data from websites, and interact with RESTful APIs.

##### INSTALLATION:
Provide the below command in your terminal or bash
```bash
!pip3 install requests
```

## PANDAS
**`Pandas`** is a popular open-source data manipulation and analysis library for Python. It provides easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for working with structured data, making it an essential tool for data scientists, analysts, and researchers.
Pandas introduces two primary data structures: `DataFrame` and `Series`.

* **DataFrame:** A two-dimensional table or spreadsheet-like data structure that consists of rows and columns. It can store heterogeneous data types and is commonly used to represent structured data, such as CSV files or database tables.
* **Series:** A one-dimensional array-like object that can hold data of any type. Series are often used to represent a single column or row of data within a DataFrame.

we use dataframes to store the data retrieved from the webpage.

##### INSTALLATION:
Provide the below command in your terminal or bash
```bash
!pip3 install pandas
```
