<H2>VIEWING, ENTERING AND EDITING DATA</H2>

**VIEWING DATA**

Most commonly used parameter in ***view tab*** for viewing data

**1. ZOOM:**  
  * `ZOOM` has various percentage of viewing whole data.</br>

**2. FREEZE:**
  * `Freeze top row` - freezes first row
  * `Freeze first column` - freezes first column
  * `Freeze panes` - Select a cell which is after the cell we need to freeze and select freeze panes. 
    If we need to freeze both first row and first column; select B2( IN MY CASE); select freexe panes.</br>

    </br>
  * `Split` - This feature allows you to keep certain rows or columns visible while scrolling through a large worksheet

**ENTERING DATA**

That's so simple directly choose cells and enter the data as required.

**EDITING DATA**

1. Directly Entering Data:
  * Click on the cell you want to edit.
  * Type the new data directly into the selected cell.
2. Double-Click to Edit:
  * Place the mouse pointer on the cell where you want to add or edit data.
  * Double-click on the cell.
  * The cell will become active for editing, and you can enter or modify the data.
3. F2 Key for Editing:
  * Select the cell you want to edit.
  * Press the F2 key on your keyboard (or fn + F2 if you're using a laptop with the fn key).
  * The selected cell becomes active for editing, and you can enter or modify the data.

<H2>COPYING, FILLING AND FORMATTING CELLS AND DATA</H2>

**COPYING:**

* Ordinary copy and paste.
* hold ctrl + drag cell or range of cells need to copy onto the required location. [ï£¿: ctlr + option]

**FILLING:**

* Auto fill using fill handle for sequential data

**FORMATTING**

* Formatting cells - adding colors to cells [rows / columns], cell data type
* Formatting text in cells - Bold, italize, underline, change font size, color, alignment
* Formatting numbers in a cell - formatting decimal palces, currencies

<H2>THE BASIC FORMULAS AND FUNCTIONS</H2>
FORMULAS ARE IDENTIFIED BY EXCEL ON ENCOUNTER OF SYMBOL '='
EG. =SUM(A1,B1) 

COMMON FUNCTIONS USED FOR STATISTICAL CALCULATIONS:
= SUM()
= COUNT()
= MEDIAN()
= AVG()
= MIN()
= MAX()
CELLS VALUES CAN BE SELECTED MANUALLY OR CAN MENTION CELL RANGE

**RELATIVE REFERENCES VS ABSOLUTE REFERENCES**

**RELATIVE REFERENCE:** By default excel uses relative reference and are without dollar sign ($).
The relative reference makes the cells reference free. It gives the fill function freedom to continue the order without restrictions.

**ABSOLUTE REFERENCE:** It is a command which tells Excel to lock a reference.
The dollar sign ($) is used to make references absolute.

- Example of relative reference: A1
- Example of absolute reference: $A$1

**LIST OF ERROR CODES**
#N/A
#NAME?
#NULL!
#REF!
#VALUE!
#DIV/0!

**Summary and Highlights**
* There are several features to modify views in Excel, and it is very straightforward to enter and edit data in a spreadsheet. 
* You can move or copy data within a worksheet or between worksheets, and you can use AutoFill to automatically enter data that is in a series or that fits a pattern. 
* You can format both cells and data in Excel. 
* A formula is made up of several component parts, and formulas can perform calculations using numbers directly or by using references to data in the worksheet. 
* You can use the Fill Handle in Excel to quickly copy formulas to other cells. 
* There are several different categories of function you can use for different purposes, and you can search for a function by name, or by category. 
* You can reference cells in the worksheet in your formulas by using relative, absolute, or mixed references. 
* You can make a formula absolute by adding a dollar symbol ($) to a cell reference. 
* If you get errors in your formulas, you can use the error-checking capabilities of Excel to resolve them.
