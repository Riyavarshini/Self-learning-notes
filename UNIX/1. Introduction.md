<h1>UNIX</h1>
The `Unix operating system` is a set of programs that act as a link between the computer and the user.  

The `kernel` is a specific part of the operating system responsible for tasks such as process scheduling, memory management, and communication with hardware.  

The `shell` is a user interface that allows users to interact with the operating system by entering commands. It acts as a command interpreter, taking user commands and translating them into instructions that the kernel can understand and execute.  
There are different types of shells, and they can be broadly categorized into two main types:
1. Command-Line Interface (CLI) Shells:
Users interact with the operating system by typing commands into a text-based interface.
Examples include the Bash shell (used in Linux and Unix), Command Prompt (used in Windows), and the Terminal (used in macOS).
2. Graphical User Interface (GUI) Shells:
Users interact with the operating system through a graphical interface with icons, windows, and menus.
Examples include the Windows Explorer interface in Microsoft Windows and the desktop environment in macOS.
