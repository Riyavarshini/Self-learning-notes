<h1> FILE MANGEMENT IN UNIX </h1>
All data in Unix is organized into files. All files are organized into directories. These directories are organized into a tree-like structure called the filesystem.  

In Unix, there are three basic types of files:</br>

* Ordinary Files:    An ordinary file is a file on the system that contains data, text, or program instructions.
* Special Files:    A special files are files that provide access to specific devices or kernel-related functions. These files are often found in the `/dev` directory.

    Here are some common special files found in the /dev directory:

    1. /dev/null: Represents the null device; any data written to this file is discarded.
    2. /dev/zero: Provides an endless stream of null bytes when read.
    3. /dev/random and /dev/urandom: Provide access to the kernel's random number generator.
    4. /dev/tty: Represents the terminal device.
    5. /dev/sda, /dev/sdb, etc.: Represent block devices such as hard drives.

* Directories:    Directories store both special and ordinary files. For users familiar with Windows or Mac OS, Unix directories are equivalent to folders.

<H2> LISTING FILES COMMANDS:</H2>

* `$ls`    Lists all files and directories in current directory
    ```
    ~ % ls
    Applications	Downloads	Music		VirtualBox VMs	pipe_.R
    Desktop		Library		Pictures	blackeye
    Documents	Movies		Public		facets.R
    ```

* `$ls -l`    get more information about the listed files</br>
  [File type or permission | memory blocks of file or directory | Owner who created file | group of owner | filesize in bytes | date time creation or updation |file or directory name]
  ```
    ~ % ls -l
    total 16

    drwxr-xr-x+  5 user_name  staff   160 Jun 17  2022 Public
    drwx------   5 user_name  staff   160 Dec 16 14:48 VirtualBox VMs

    -rw-r--r--   1 user_name  staff   450 Jul  1 20:22 pipe_.R
  ```
Every file line begins with a d, -, or l.
| Prefix | Description |
|:-------|:--------------------------------|
| d | Directory file that contains a listing of other files and directories |
| l | Symbolic link file. Links on any regular file |
| - | Regular file, such as an ASCII text file, binary executable, or hard link |
| b | Block special file. Block input/output device file such as a physical hard drive |
| c | Character special file. Raw input/output device file such as a physical hard drive |
| p | Named pipe. A mechanism for interprocess communications |
| s | Socket used for interprocess communication |

<h2> METACHARACTERS</h2>

Metacharacters have a special meaning in Unix. For example, * and ? are metacharacters. We use * to match 0 or more characters, a question mark (?) matches with a single character.

* `$ls Screenshot*.png`    Displays all the files, the names of which start with *`Screenshot`* and ends with *`.png`*  
```
% ls Screenshot*.png

<h2> HIDDEN FILES</h2>

An invisible file is one, the first character of which is the dot or the period character (.). Unix programs (including the shell) use most of these files to store configuration information.
> Some common examples of the hidden files include the files: </BR>
    `.profile` − The Bourne shell ( sh) initialization script  
    `.kshrc` − The Korn shell ( ksh) initialization script  
    `.cshrc` − The C shell ( csh) initialization script  
    `.rhosts` − The remote shell configuration file  
    single dot (.) --> current directory  
    Double dot (..) --> Parent directory  


* `$ ls -a`    lists all Hidden files
```
% ls -a
.			.jupyter		.zshrc.swp        ..			.local			Applications
.CFUserTextEncoding	.matplotlib		Desktop    .DS_Store		.oracle_jre_usage	Documents
.RData			.python_history		Downloads    .RDataTmp		.sqldeveloper		Library
.Rapp.history		.tcshrc			Movies    .Rhistory		.vim			Music
.Trash			.viminfo		Pictures    .android		.xonshrc		Public
.anydesk		.zprofile		VirtualBox VMs    .bash_profile		.zsh_history		blackeye
.config			.zsh_sessions		facets.R    .fontconfig		.zshrc			pipe_.R
.idlerc			.zshrc.swn    .ipython		.zshrc.swo

```

<h2>CREATING FILES</h2>
vi is a text editor available on Unix and Unix-like operating systems, including Linux. It is a powerful and widely used command-line text editor that provides both normal mode (for navigation and manipulation) and insert mode (for entering and editing text).

Can use the vi editor to create ordinary files on any Unix system.
* `vi anyfilename`    open file with given filename
